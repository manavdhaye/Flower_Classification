# 🌸 Flower Classification using CNN

This project is a **deep learning-based image classification system** that identifies flowers from five categories:

- Daisy
- Dandelion
- Rose
- Sunflower
- Tulip

It uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture built with TensorFlow/Keras, and includes **image augmentation** techniques to improve generalization.
